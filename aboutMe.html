                My passion for coding began seven years ago when I first started creating tools in excel for students
                and teachers. These tools were simple, but allowed teachers to instantly have their students'
                assignments graded and recieve analysis on student progress and areas of need. Since then, I have worked
                with schools and organizations to implement software solutions to their educational needs, culminating
                in my second company, SHSAT School, which provided a complete learning environment to schools,
                organizations, and students.

                While I have always been passionate about solving complicated issues for clients, and have increasingly
                looked at software solutions, my time working on SHSAT School software ignited my desire to become a
                fulltime software developer. I am curently attending Rithm School where I intend to learn the skills
                necessary to become a software developer. In my free time I love building tools and applications that I
                wish I'd had access to as an educator.
